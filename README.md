# Timestamps
This tiny application returns timestamps for helping out when creating test data.

## Compiling
    > maven clean install
    
## Running
    > java -jar timestamps-application.jar server config.yml
    
## Disclaimer
Yes, there is a multitude of software out there that excel at generating test data of all kinds but sometimes you just
want a timestamp to use in a Postman or Curl request and then having it online is a pretty appealing solution for the
lazy developer.
